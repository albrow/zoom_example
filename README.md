A simple json/rest server that makes use of my go+redis ORM library, [zoom](https://github.com/stephenalexbrowne/zoom).

Note: this repository is no longer maintained. Instead, you should look at https://github.com/albrow/peeps-negroni for
an up-to-date example on how zoom can integrate with an json/rest API.
